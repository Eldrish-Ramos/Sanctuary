# Digital Shrine Backend

## Overview
Digital Shrine is a platform that allows users to create personalized interactive webpages, known as "shrines." This backend service is built using Node.js and Express.js, providing the necessary API endpoints to support the frontend application.

## Project Structure
- **src/**: Contains the source code for the backend application.
  - **controllers/**: Handles incoming requests and defines the logic for user and shrine-related operations.
  - **models/**: Defines the data structures for users and shrines, typically using an ORM for database interactions.
  - **routes/**: Defines the API endpoints for the application, linking routes to their respective controllers.
  - **services/**: Encapsulates business logic and interacts with models, providing a clean interface for controllers.
  - **app.js**: The entry point for the backend application, initializing the Express app, setting up middleware, and connecting routes.
